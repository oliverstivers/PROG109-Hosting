    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
    <p>I have done a bit of coding in each HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the past, but generally only knew what the basic
        purpose of each was before taking the class. Javascript was fairly easy to learn though, as I am familiar with
        Java, where I have learned concepts like functions, classes, objects, heirarchies, etc, so that part of
        Javascript was easy to learn, and I just had to translate it into Javascript syntax.</p>
    <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
    <p>I decided to use a template, as I wanted to focus more on the content of my portfolio and making that look nice,
        rather than trying to figure out a layout all on my own.</p>
    <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of the portfolio was probably the artifacts, as they were often more in depth than the
        module assignments and really required a lot of attention to get right. CSS was also difficult, as design in
        general is more challenging for me to wrap my head around and required a lot of looking into other resources in
        order to make things look and lay out in the way that I wanted.</p>
    <h2>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </h2>
    <p>This class has in general made me a lot more interested in web development, and I have enjoyed learning about
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript a lot. It has definitely made me more open to trying to make websites in the future,
        as I now know where to start and good places to look in order to find what I need.</p>
    <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
    <p>I would recommend to not be afraid to look at lots of different resources, as there are lots of different ways to
        solve different problems, which may be easier or more difficult depending on how the website is structured. You
        don't always (and probbably shouldnt') want to do something in the same one way, as in many other situations,
        there can be a more efficient, cleaner, easier, and better way to solve the problem.</p>
